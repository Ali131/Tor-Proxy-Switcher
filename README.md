TOR Proxy Switcher :~

It is a simple GUI tool. Which switches the TOR IP's. It was not actually all written by me.
The original version written by anonghost (a popular programer/hacker). But when i was found it,
it was not working. Then i correct the script and tested by my self in all respect.

How to use?

First of all install vidalia control panel. Then run it. Then run the script. It will be working great.
Note: It can't run with TOR browser only, you must need vidalia control panel.
